# socklog-overlay

The socklog-overlay is an add-on for the
[s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) - it provides
a small syslog replacement based on Gerrit Pape's [socklog](http://smarden.org/socklog/).

## Usage

Installation is similar to installing the `s6-overlay`:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

# Install s6-overlay
ADD https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/releases/download/v1.21.8.0/s6-overlay-amd64.tar.gz /tmp/
RUN tar xzf /tmp/s6-overlay-amd64.tar.gz -C /

# Install socklog-overlay
ADD https://github.com/just-containers/socklog-overlay/releases/download/v3.1.1-1/socklog-overlay-amd64.tar.gz /tmp/
RUN tar xzf /tmp/socklog-overlay-amd64.tar.gz -C /

ENTRYPOINT ["/init"]
```

This will run a logging service with all messages in directories under `/var/log/socklog/`,
with built-in log rotation.

* `/var/log/socklog/cron`
* `/var/log/socklog/daemon`
* `/var/log/socklog/debug`
* `/var/log/socklog/errors`
* `/var/log/socklog/everything`
* `/var/log/socklog/kernel`
* `/var/log/socklog/mail`
* `/var/log/socklog/messages`
* `/var/log/socklog/secure`
* `/var/log/socklog/user`

## Customization

### Custom logging rules

`socklog-overlay` works by reading in a series of `s6-log` logging scripts from
`/etc/socklog.rules`. You can create your own rules by placing a file in
`/etc/socklog.rules`. Each directive (selection directive, control directive,
or action directive) for the logging script should be on its own line.

For example, if you wanted to save all errors for messages tagged with the
"local0" facility, you could create the file `/etc/socklog.rules/local0-error`

```
-
+^local0\.err
T
/var/log/socklog/local0-errors
```

This will match lines that begin with `local0.err`, prepend them with an ISO8601 timestamp, and save them to the `/var/log/socklog/local0-errors` folder.

Another example, if you wanted to have all syslog messages copied to stdout,
create a file at `/etc/socklog.rules/forward-stdout`:

```
+
1
```

This will match all lines (as indicated by the `+` symbol with an empty regex),
and forward them to stdout (indicated by the `1` symbol).

More details on how to write `s6-log` logging scripts are available in the
[s6-log manual](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html).

### Creating logging folders

The `/etc/cont-init.d/~-socklog` script should run last, and its final step
is to recursively chown `/var/log/socklog`.

Create a script in `/etc/cont-init.d` to make your needed logging folder,
if it's a subfolder of `/var/log/socklog`, you should be covered. If not,
you'll likely need to chown it as well, to the `nobody` user.

### Environment variables

* `SOCKLOG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT` - controls how (or if) a timestamp should be placed
before every line, defaults to `T`
  * (empty) - do not insert timestamps into logs
  * `T` - prepend every line with an ISO 8601 timestamp
  * `t` - prepend every line with a TAI64N timestamp

## Ideas I'd like to flesh out:

* Setting an environment variable to specify number of files, size, etc
  * Right now this is just using the `s6-log` defaults - 10 files, ~100k per file

## Verifying Downloads

The `socklog-overlay` releases are signed using `gpg`, you can import our public key:

```bash
$ curl https://keybase.io/justcontainers/key.asc | gpg --import
```

Then verify the downloaded files:

```bash
$ gpg --verify socklog-overlay-amd64.tar.gz.sig socklog-overlay-amd64.tar.gz
```

## Upgrade Notes

### 3.0.0

`socklog-overlay` version 3.0.0 switched from having the hard-coded
`log/run` script with log pattern rules, to using the `/etc/socklog.rules`
folder. If you have a custom `log/run` script, it should continue to work.

### 3.1.0

Added the `SOCKLOG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT` environment variable.

### 3.1.1

Compatibility update with skalibs v2.10+
